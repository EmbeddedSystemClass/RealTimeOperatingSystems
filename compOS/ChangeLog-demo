demo7:

- last demo version, i forget all the changes i made!!!!!

- added thread support

----------------------------------------------------------
demo6:

- Added kalloc() and kfree() functions using bget as a backend.

- Created a simple console device, currently only works as a teletypewriter.

- Added full file support. read(), write() etc. on a file handle. Files can
	only be opened using OpenDevice() so far.

- better keyboard and video devices.

- lots of internal changes.

- updated all documentation files.

- removed the wait for keypress before jumping into kernel.

- updated file extensions to reflect what they are compiled with.

- overhauled the Makefile's.

- moved config options to config.mak and added some more options. The system
	should now be more user-friendly.

- added support for the Bochs emulator with a bochrc file.
	See http://bochs.sourceforge.net/

- changed all files from windows CR-LF format to unix LF format.

----------------------------------------------------------
demo5:

- added support for devices.

- added null device, similar to unix /dev/null and /dev/zero.

- changed keyboard code to a device.

- added video device, still using the VidWrite() style functions though.

- changed compiler to g++ for type safety, no C++ features actually used.

- updated Acknowledgements, Memory and Readme, added TODO file.

- improved the GDT code, added several new GDT management functions.

- added more config options.

----------------------------------------------------------
demo4:

- added a very crude floppy disk driver.

- corrected an error in "include.mak" so we can compile under linux.

- introduced standard types.

----------------------------------------------------------

- first code demo, the kernel is just an infinite loop. This is only to prove we can actually boot.
