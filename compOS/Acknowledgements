Code and information has been taken from quite a few places
and i'll try to list them all here.

Firstly, the boot code and makefiles are based on code from
GeekOS v0.0.1c, and since so much code has been included from
GeekOS I have included the copyright notice, see "COPYING-GEEKOS".
The scripts are taken directly from GeekOS, and so are the assembly
language include files (include/*.s). GeekOS can be found at
http://geekos.sourceforge.net/.

The assembly code in <asm.h> is taken from Linux v0.01. If you
dont already know, linux is at http://www.kernel.org/. Version 0.01
of the kernel is archived at
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/Historic/.

Some of the video memory code and definitions have been taken
from GeekOS, with changes to fit the linux-style assembly
definitions mentioned above. Most of the other video memory
code has been written using GeekOS as a guide.

The routine to display messages in the boot and setup code was
taken from the JOSH operating system tutorial. Also, the code to
wait for a keypress before starting the kernel was taken from the
shell for JOSH. Currently, this is at http://www.ansanest.com/josh/.

Other information was found at the following places, but no code was
taken (note: some of this is miscallaneous information on things like
floppy drives and elf file formats, but it all seemed useful to me):

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
For version demo4:

 The floppy disk driver stuff is taken from linux v0.11, stored in the same place as v0.01.
 
Not much else has been taken from anywhere for this release.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
For version demo5:

 Nothing - although the device model is based on the UN*X philosophy that everything is a file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
demo6:

 Some ideas taken from GeekOS, but all the new code is my own.
